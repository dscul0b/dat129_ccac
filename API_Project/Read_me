Here is my API Project

I used the API available at http://api.dataatwork.org/v1/spec/

It writes a txt file of the results for a search done based on what the URL is.

I tried to figure out how to create a variable in the URL itself to customize it more, but I couldn't figure that out. 

Right now, to search for jobs, the user has to change the url and change the message to match what job they are searching for. 

It does print a nice message telling the user how many jobs are available with that search parameter. 

For instance there are 44 jobs on the API with the term "programmer" in it.

Cool!
