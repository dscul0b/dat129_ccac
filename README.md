## About Me
Hello! My name is Dan Scullin. I am an Operations and Logistics Coordinator for 412 Food Rescue based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. 

Our mission at 412FR is to #END food waste by preventing viable food from entering the waste cycle, and to instead redirect that food to those who are in need. It's pretty neat!

I am currently learning Python and QGIS software at CCAC in order to utilize these tools to help end food waste and hunger.
